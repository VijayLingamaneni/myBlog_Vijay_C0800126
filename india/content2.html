                    Mumbai is the capital city of the Indian state of Maharashtra. According to the United Nations,
                    as of 2018, Mumbai is the second-most populous city in the country after Delhi and the seventh-most
                    populous city in the world with a population of roughly 20 million. As per Indian government
                    population census of 2011, Mumbai was the most populous city in India with an estimated city proper
                    population of 12.5 million living under Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai. Mumbai is the
                    centre of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, the sixth most populous metropolitan area in the world
                    with a population of over 23 million. Mumbai lies on the Konkan coast on the west coast of India
                    and has a deep natural harbour. In 2008, Mumbai was named an alpha world city. It has the
                    highest number of millionaires and billionaires among all cities in India. Mumbai is home to
                    three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Elephanta Caves, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, and
                    the city's distinctive ensemble of Victorian and Art Deco buildings.

                    The seven islands that constitute Mumbai were originally home to communities of Marathi language
                    speaking Koli people. For centuries, the islands were under the control of successive
                    indigenous empires before being ceded to the Portuguese Empire and subsequently to the East India
                    Company when in 1661 Charles II of England married Catherine of Braganza and as part of her dowry
                    Charles received the ports of Tangier and Seven Islands of Bombay. During the mid-18th century,
                    Bombay was reshaped by the Hornby Vellard project, which undertook reclamation of the area
                    between the seven islands from the sea. Along with construction of major roads and railways, the
                    reclamation project, completed in 1845, transformed Bombay into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea.
                    Bombay in the 19th century was characterised by economic and educational development. During the
                    early 20th century it became a strong base for the Indian independence movement. Upon India's
                    independence in 1947 the city was incorporated into Bombay State. In 1960, following the Samyukta
                    Maharashtra Movement, a new state of Maharashtra was created with Bombay as the capital.
