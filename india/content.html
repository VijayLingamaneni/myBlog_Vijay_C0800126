                        Delhi is one of the oldest cities in the world, and has been continuously inhabited since the
                        6th century BCE. Through most of its history, Delhi has served as a capital of various
                        kingdoms and empires, most notably the Tomars, Chahamanas, Delhi Sultanate and Mughals. It is
                        also assumed to be the location of Indraprastha, the capital of the Pandavas in the epic
                        Mahabharata. The city has been captured, ransacked and rebuilt several times, particularly
                        during the medieval period, and modern Delhi is a cluster of a number of cities spread across
                        the metropolitan region. For many centuries Delhi has been a dominant trading and commercial
                        centre in northern India, and since the 1990s it has emerged as an important node in the
                        international corporate and financial network.

                        Although a union territory, the political administration of the NCT of Delhi today more closely
                        resembles that of a state of India, with its own legislature, high court and an executive
                        council of ministers headed by a Chief Minister. New Delhi is jointly administered by the
                        federal government of India and the local government of Delhi, and serves as the capital of the
                        nation as well as the NCT of Delhi. Delhi hosted the inaugural 1951 Asian Games, 1982 Asian
                        Games, 1983 NAM Summit, 2010 Men's Hockey World Cup, 2010 Commonwealth Games, 2012 BRICS Summit
                        and was one of the major host cities of the 2011 Cricket World Cup.

                        Delhi is also the centre of the National Capital Region (NCR), which is a unique 'interstate
                        regional planning' area created by the National Capital Region Planning Board Act of
                        1985.

                <p>
                    There are a number of myths and legends associated with the origin of the name Delhi. One of them is
                    derived from Dhillu or Dilu, a king who built a city at this location in 50 BCE and named it after
                    himself. Another legend holds that the name of the city is based on the Hindi/Prakrit
                    word dhili (loose) and that it was used by the Tomaras to refer to the city because the iron pillar
                    of Delhi had a weak foundation and had to be moved. According to Panjab Notes and Queries, the
                    name of the city at the time of King Prithviraj was dilpat, and that dilpat and dilli are probably
                    derived from the old Hindi word dil meaning "eminence". The former director of the Archaeological
                    Survey of India, Alexander Cunningham, mentioned that dilli later became dihli/dehli. Some
                    suggest the coins in circulation in the region under the Tomaras were called dehliwal. According
                    to the Bhavishya Purana, King Prithiviraja of Indraprastha built a new fort in the modern-day Purana
                    Qila area for the convenience of all four castes in his kingdom. He ordered the construction of a
                    gateway to the fort and later named the fort dehali. Some historians believe that Dhilli or
                    Dhillika is the original name for the city while others believe the name could be a corruption of
                    the Hindustani words dehleez or dehali—both terms meaning "threshold" or "gateway"—and symbolic of
                    the city as a gateway to the Gangetic Plain.

                    The area around Delhi was probably inhabited before the second millennium BCE and there is evidence
                    of continuous inhabitation since at least the 6th-century BCE. There was Ochre Coloured Pottery
                    culture in Red fort area which began around c.2600 BCE. Around c.1200 BCE the region was inhabited
                    by people of Painted Grey Ware culture and was part of Kuru Kingdom. The city is believed to be
                    the site of Indraprastha, the legendary capital of the Pandavas in the Indian epic Mahabharata.
                    According to the Mahabharata, this land was initially a huge mass of forests called
                    'Khandavaprastha' which was burnt down by the Pandavas to build the city of Indraprastha. Later
                    Kurus were defeated by the non-Vedic Salva tribe.

                    The earliest architectural relics date back to the Maurya period (c. 300 BCE); in 1966, an
                    inscription of the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka (273–235 BCE) was discovered near Srinivaspuri. Remains of
                    several major cities can be found in Delhi. The first of these were in the southern part of
                    present-day Delhi. King Anang Pal of the Tomara dynasty founded the city of Lal Kot in 1052 CE.
                    Prithviraj Chauhan conquered Lal Kot in 1178 and renamed it Qila Rai Pithora.
