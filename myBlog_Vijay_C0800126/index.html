                    India, officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya), is a country in South Asia.
                    It is the second-most populous country, the seventh-largest country by land area, and the most
                    populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the
                    southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the
                    west China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the
                    Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar
                    Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar and Indonesia.

                    Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.
                    Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the
                    region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity. Settled life emerged on
                    the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually
                    into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE. By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of
                    Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest, unfolding as
                    the language of the Rigveda, and recording the dawning of Hinduism in India. The Dravidian
                    languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions. By 400 BCE,
                    stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism, and Buddhism and Jainism had
                    arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity. Early political consolidations gave rise
                    to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin. Their collective era was
                    suffused with wide-ranging creativity, but also marked by the declining status of women, and
                    the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief In South India, the
                    Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of
                    Southeast Asia.

                    In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism put down roots on
                    India's southern and western coasts. Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran
                    India's northern plains, eventually establishing the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India
                    into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam. In the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire
                    created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India. In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged,
                    rejecting institutionalised religion. The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of
                    relative peace, leaving a legacy of luminous architecture Gradually expanding rule of
                    the British East India Company followed, turning India into a colonial economy, but also
                    consolidating its sovereignty. British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians
                    were granted slowly, but technological changes were introduced, and ideas of education,
                    modernity and the public life took root. A pioneering and influential nationalist movement
                    emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British
                    rule. In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions, a
                    Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss
                    of life and an unprecedented migration.

                    According to the Oxford English Dictionary (third edition 2009), the name "India" is derived from
                    the Classical Latin India, a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east; and in
                    turn derived successively from: Hellenistic Greek India ( Ἰνδία); ancient Greek Indos ( Ἰνδός); Old
                    Persian Hindush, an eastern province of the Achaemenid empire; and ultimately its cognate, the
                    Sanskrit Sindhu, or "river," specifically the Indus River and, by implication, its well-settled
                    southern basin.
                    The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi (Ἰνδοί), which
                    translates as "The people of the Indus".

                    The term Bharat , mentioned in both Indian
                    epic poetry and the Constitution of India,
                    is used in its variations by many Indian
                    languages. A modern rendering of the historical name Bharatavarsha, which applied originally to
                    northern India,
                    Bharat gained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name
                    for India.

                    Hindustan is a Middle Persian name for India, introduced
                    during the Mughal Empire and used widely since. Its meaning has varied, referring to a region
                    encompassing present-day northern India and Pakistan or to India in its near entirety.

                <p>
                    By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian
                    subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved. The earliest known modern
                    human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago. After 6500 BCE, evidence for
                    domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of
                    agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan, Pakistan.
                    These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation, the first urban culture in
                    South Asia, which flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in what is now Pakistan and western India.
                    Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on
                    varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging
                    trade.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the period 2000–500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic
                    cultures to the Iron Age ones. The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,
                    were composed during this period, and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in
                    the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain. Most historians also consider this period to
                    have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the
                    north-west. The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants,
                    but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this
                    period. On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence
                    of a chiefdom stage of political organisation. In South India, a progression to sedentary life
                    is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period, as well as by
                    nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.
